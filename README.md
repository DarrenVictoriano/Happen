# Happen
The making of the ultimate Project ONE.

## Naming Conventions
HTML and CSS: dash-case-naming  
JS: CamelCaseNaming

## Branches Rules
Master Branch should always be a working code.  
Dev Branch this is where we combined or assemble our code from each branch, then we merge it to master.  
"Feature_Name" branch - create your own branch and name it based on the feature you are working on.  

## Color Code Information
The MaterialiceCss framework gives us the hex code and a class name for changing the background color or the text color.  
Below you'll find the color, the hex code, the class name to changed the background, and the class name to change the text.

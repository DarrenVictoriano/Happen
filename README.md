# Happen
The making of the ultimate Project ONE.

## Naming Conventions
HTML and CSS: dash-case-naming  
JS: CamelCaseNaming

## Branches Rules
Master Branch should always be a working code.  
Dev Branch this is where we combined or assemble our code from each branch, then we merge it to master.  
"Feature_Name" branch - create your own branch and name it based on the feature you are working on.
